Functions:
- SmoothUV
- SSHiQ

Syntax
1) SSHiQ(int rY, int rC, int tY, int tC, int str, boolean HQY,
	 boolean HQC, field)
   - rY and rC are respectively the radii for luminance and chrominance
     (how far from the current pixel neighbours are used).
     The greater the more smooth.
   - tY and tC are thresholds (details sensibility)
     The greater the more smooth (not exactly the same as fpr other
     SSHiQ filters).
   - str is the strength (only used in HiQ mode), ie how much of the
     smoothed version should be used at best for calculating the new
     pixel
   - HQY and HQC tell whether to use the HiQ mode, where the edge
     information automatically reduce the strength value.
     (HQ == 0) ? smoothed_pixel :
                 ( (strength-edge*2)*smoothed_pixel +
                   (256-(strength-edge*2))*pixel_in )/256
   - field allows you to process independantly fields (risks of worse
     blurring/color bleeding)

2) SmoothUV (used to reduce rainbows, as done by smartsmoothIQ)
   SmoothUV(int radius,int threshold, boolean field)
   - radius is the range operation
   - threshold is the one used in smartsmoothIQ
   - field is the same as above
  This filter doesn't process the luma at all, and can be seen as a
  shorter version of SSHiQ(rY,radius,-1, threshold, 255, false, false, field)

Revision history
- 1.4.0 (2003/09/02):
  . Fixed HQ mode for radius > 4
  . Added radius 7
- 1.3.1 (2003/08/31):
  . Speed improvement
  . Increased the edge influence, therefore increasing the HiQ part :)
- 1.3.0: Many fixes:
  . Interlaced modes work without crashing
  . Interlaced HiQ mode work (normal interlaced mode was used before)
  . Add support for radii 5 and 6, at the cost of speed; could add
    bigger radius but it's starting to be really useless
  . Fixed convolution: all pixels intended to be used are now used
  . Speed improvement; but with the above fix, you shouldn't notice it :)
- 1.2.0: Fix for SmoothUV() function, warn in this readme for radius>4
- 1.1.0: I think the first public release
